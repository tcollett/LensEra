# About the project

Gravitational lensing was first theorised by Albert Einstein to describe how light bends when it travels past massive objects like galaxies and galaxy clusters. Despite being a powerful cosmological probe for matter distribution, strong gravitational lensing is hamstrung by the small number of lensing systems: only a few hundred systems are known. The EU-funded LensEra project plans to combine machine learning, citizen science and automated lens modelling to build an engine to find 30 000 new lensing systems in the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope data in Chile. Analysis of subsets of lens populations should enable astronomers to explore the most profound questions of our Universe, including the nature of dark matter and the measurement of dark energy's equation of state.
